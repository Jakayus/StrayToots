# Stray Toots

This Project creates a Mastadon Client that is used on the Apple Watch system. 

This client app aims to do the following:
- Allow user to log into an instance with their account and view their timeline (more details TBD)
- Allow user to "Favourite" a toot
- Allow user to "Boost" a toot

Although the app could be expanded more in the future, it is limited in scope due to personal time restrictions.
